# Students_result_using_list-
This Python script processes student results, adding a total marks column, and calculates average marks for theory and practical/viva. It determines pass/fail status based on thresholds (33 for theory/practical/viva, 50 overall). The script iterates through results, computes sums and averages, and prints the final pass/fail status.
